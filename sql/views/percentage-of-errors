Description: Returns dates that have HTTP errors that comprise of errors greater tna 1% of all requests
  Dependant: none
  Operation:
      Step 1 - Count all requests per day from the log
      Step 2 - Count all requests per day where the error code contains 4**
      Step 3 - Calculate the error percentage
      Step 4 - Return the table to the caller

    Formula:
      percentage_of_errors = request_count / error_count * 100
